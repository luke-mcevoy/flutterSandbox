## What is Flutter
- "Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase." [Flutter.dev](http://flutter.dev)

## What language do you use with Flutter
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- "Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and type inference." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language))
